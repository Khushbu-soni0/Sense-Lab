It is Machine learning base Malaria detection service. In this service I have created algorithm to detect Malaria using blood cell images. I have used dataset from national Library of medicine. A frontend is based on HTML and CSS. I create model with using different libraries such as TensorFlow JS, Pandas, CNN, DNN.
